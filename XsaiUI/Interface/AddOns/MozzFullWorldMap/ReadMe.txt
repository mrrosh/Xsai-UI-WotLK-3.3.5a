Current Version
---------------

MozzFullWorldMap (Fan's Update) v3.34.30000
WotLK ready.




General Description
-------------------

Show Unexplored Areas on the WorldMap, and now also on AlphaMap (Fan's Update)

MozzFullWorldMap is simple: it adds a new checkbox in the upper left of the world map named 'Show Unexplored Areas'. Checking it will do just that.

Key binding available for users of AlphaMap / Cartographer / MetaMap
(NOTE : The key binding is disabled while the WorldMap is open - unless the World Map has been modified by another AddOn such as AlphaMap)

The default settings mean that unexplored areas appear with a blue/green tinge. I believe this setting is the most useful as it means that you can see all the details of the map, while still being able to identify which areas you have not yet explored.
You can change the behaviour of the AddOn via the Slash commands detailed below, and remove the blue tinge completely, leaving you with a standard view of each map as though you had already explored every area :)

This AddOn is compatible with :
WorldMapFrame,
AlphaMap,
MetaMap (you should disable MetaMapFWM if using this AddOn)
Cartographer (you should disable Foglight if using this AddOn)

This AddOn adds a 'Show Unexplored Areas' checkbox to your world map.

Uses a hardcoded set of overlay data which duplicates data available in the client.  Since it
also queries the client to find out which overlays should be 100%, it will detect discrepancies
in the client data and record any mismatched or not-present data in a saved Errata table.


Original by Mozz, updated by Shub, and currently kept alive by Telic.
