AzCastBar
---------
A highly customizable and lightweight casting bar replacement mod with support for saved profiles and plugins.

Originally comes with the following plugins: casting bar for player, target, focus and pet, as well as a mirror bar. The Mirror Bar is the one which shows breath, feign death and fatigue.

The option dialog along with the saved profiles are Load on Demand, which means it will only be loaded and take up memory once you open the Options.

The player cast bar supports safe zone indication for both cast and channeled spells. This is basically your latency, when the spellcast has passed this point, you can safely cancel the cast and have the spell still fire.

The slash command for AzCastBar is /acb. Using it will open the the option dialog.

You can clear all plugin settings and reset them to their defaults by using the slash command "/acb wipeconfig". This does not affect the saved profiles.

Lacking Features, Ideas & Problems
----------------------------------
- Target Buff Timers Plugin: I plan on adding a filter to this, so you can filter out any buffs you do not want to clutter up the bars.
- Player Buff Timers Plugin: Both buffs and debuffs are shown on the same bar config, there is no option for people who wish to show debuffs seperate to buffs.
