My Media Creator

This is an Addon to help you insert your Media into LibSharedMedia
It is designed to be a standalone Addon so it will never get deleted by
WoWAceUpdater

* Extract zip to WoWFolder\Interface\Addons\
* run MyMediaCreator.bat (doubleclick it..)
* Put your Mediafiles inside the font, background,.. folders
* continue the batchfile
* you should be able to use your Media now inside WoW

MyMediaSharedMedia.bat does nearly the same but it is designed to be used from
inside the SharedMedia Folder if you wish to create your MyMedia files there.
Just copy / move it to Interface\Addons\SharedMedia and run it.
It does what "INSTRUCTIONS for MyMedia.txt" says but needs files in those 
subfolders since the .bat needs to know what type of media your file is.
