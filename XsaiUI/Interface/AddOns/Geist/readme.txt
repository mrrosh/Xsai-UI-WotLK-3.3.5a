Geist v30000.4 - Quick mouse access for up to 25 buttons.
by Cidrei (Jazrei of Zangarmarsh-US)
---

How to use:
-- Bind a key to Geist. Geist will display whenever that key is pressed with the cursor over the center button.
-- ButtonFacade support is enabled via the /bf command in ButtonFacade.

Slash commands can be found in commands.txt.

Future Plans:
-- Stuff and junk.

How you can help:
-- Localizations. If you use the mod, and speak one of the languages WoW is available in, feel free to translate the localization file into your language. Contributors get full credit of course.
-- Bug reports. Because they don't get fixed if I don't know about them.
-- Feature suggestions. Always interested in new ideas.
-- General comments. It's nice to know people actually use something that I created.
-- Code suggestions. If you know Lua, and know a better means of doing something, by all means, let me know. I'm always ready to learn.

Code Credit:
-- Hannesz, for providing the deDE locale file. First ever translation!
-- Alestane and Iriel for information and examples on the new secure frames.
-- All the mod authors whose code I've learned and borrowed from. I've looked through a lot of addons, and they've really help.
-- www.wowwiki.com. For the excellent documentation of the WoW API.
-- Blizzard. Because I never wanted to play another game in my life. >_<

Recognition:
-- oofnish (Chase Grund), the author of Ghost Bar. There wouldn't have been a GhostBarMod (or Geist) without the original.
-- My friends on Zangarmarsh. Part of the reason I'm still playing the game.
-- The commenters on all the addon sites. Your comments are what drive Geist's continued improvement. New bug reports continue to come in via these sources. Thanks.
